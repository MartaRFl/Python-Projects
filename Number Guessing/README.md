# Number Guessing
This is a game you will need to guess a number between 1-100. The program will give you some clues whenever you fail to introduce the right number.


## Updates

Currently, this scrip lacks some options that I am planning to implement in the future.

- [ ] Stablish a maximum number of attemps
- [ ] Show a plot including the already disscarded numbers.



## Technologies

This scrip uses numpy and random.
