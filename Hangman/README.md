## HANGMAN
Simple game in which you have to guess the word selected by the computer in a maximum number of attempts.

## Updates

Currently, this scrip lacks some options that I am planning to implement in the future.

- [ ] Manage the way words are selected in order to achive a wider range of potential words.
- [ ] Include the usual hangman image, which must be updated everytime the player fails to guess a letter.



## Technologies

This scrip uses the libraries random and string.
