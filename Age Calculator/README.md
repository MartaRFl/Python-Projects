# AGE CALCULATOR

A simple scrip to calculate the age of the user. The program will ask for your year of birth and return your current age.

## Updates

Currently, this scrip lacks some optios that I am planning to implement in the future.

-[ ] Allow the user to introduce it's complete date of birth in order to calculate the age precissely
-[ ] Repeat the question whenever the user introduces a non valid value
-[ ] Testing the corner cases
