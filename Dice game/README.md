# ROLL THE DICE

This is a game in which you're allowed to roll a dice as much as you want in order to achive the higher possible 
points. The trick? The moment your dice hits 6, you lost all of them!

Play clever in order to be the user who achieves the higher score.

## Updates

Currently, this scrip lacks some options that I am planning to implement in the future.

- [ ] Keep a record with the top score players.
- [ ] Show some animation when the dice is rolling
- [ ] Make so you can compeat against the computer/another player



## Technologies

This scrip uses the library random to generate a random number between 1-6.
